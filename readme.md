App overview:
Jambalaya is a recipe app. Its main function is to help users find recipes for items they
already have in their kitchen. For example, if a user has chicken and an orange
on hand, they would enter those ingredients and be given a list of 10 recipes (generated
by Yummly) that contain those ingredients, such as Duck L'orange, slow cooker orange
chicken, braised chicken with orange and scallions, etc. Users can save these
recipes to their 'collections'. A user can have many collections, which contain
many recipes. They can add another user's recipe to their own collection, and
they can enter in their own recipe.
